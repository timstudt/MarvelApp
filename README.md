# Marvelicious

iOS app that communicates with the Public Marvel API ([Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com))

## Setup

### This project uses [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org):

in terminal run: 

```
pod install
```
When prompted for `MarvelApiKey` and `MarvelPrivateKey` enter them in the terminal. 
The project uses a CocoaPods Plugin ([CocoaPods-Keys](https://guides.cocoapods.org/plugins/environment-vars.html)) for storing the Marvel API keys in the Keychain.
